2020-03-16 23:19:11	jaawerth	and as such my advice would be to check under the inexplicable pile of vhs tapes
2020-03-16 23:19:31	Kaivo	Mine is just a pile of cardboard boxes half eaten by rats and there was some water leakage in the room. All good for the shredder.

2020-03-16 23:26:50	raj	what is with this convention of putting Passport.js's serializeUser/deserializeUser methods in a file named passport.js? https://github.com/mjhea0/passport-local-knex/blob/master/src/server/auth/passport.js  makes for awkward require statements in other files that will be importing both 'passport' and also './passport' https://github.com/mjhea0/passport-local-knex/blob/master/src/server/auth/local.js#L4 . Can someone please explain the logic behind doing it
2020-03-16 23:26:51	raj	this way?

2020-03-16 23:30:12	raj	agreed
2020-03-16 23:31:11	raj	I was looking for how others on github organized their methods and files and it seems that having the serialize portion in passport.js is common, though others also put the Strategy portion in passport.js as well
2020-03-16 23:31:41	GreenJello	raj, I would probably do auth/init.js with module.exports = () => { /* passport.js init code */; /* local.js call to passport.use */ }
